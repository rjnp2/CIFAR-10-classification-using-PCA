## Understanding the Data
Before you go ahead and load the data, it's good to understand and look at the data that you will be working with!

### CIFAR - 10
The CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) dataset consists of 60000 images each of 32x32x3 color images having ten classes, with 6000 images per category. The dataset consists of 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The classes in the dataset are airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. You can download the CIFAR dataset from here, or you can also load it on the fly with the help of a deep learning library like Keras.
